An R data package with performance history data from the [New York Philharmonic](https://archives.nyphil.org/index.php/open-data).

## Installation

You can install the development version of nyphil from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

## About the data

The `nyphil` package contains performance history data from all known concerts of the [New York Philharmonic](https://nyphil.org/). Data were collected and made available by the [New York Philharmonic Archives](https://archives.nyphil.org/index.php/open-data).

There are two datasets included in the package. The dataset `nyphil` is a lightly-cleaned, tidy version of the raw data; see `?nyphil` for more info.

```{r example-nyphil}
dplyr::glimpse(nyphil)
```

The dataset `nyphil_raw` contains all the variables and original names as downloaded; see `?nyphil_raw` for more info.

```{r example-nyphil-raw}
dplyr::glimpse(nyphil_raw)
```
