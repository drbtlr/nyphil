An R data package with performance history data from the [New York Philharmonic](https://archives.nyphil.org/index.php/open-data).

## Installation

You can install the development version of nyphil from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("drbtlr/nyphil")
```

## About the data

The `nyphil` package contains performance history data from all known concerts of the [New York Philharmonic](https://nyphil.org/). Data were collected and made available by the [New York Philharmonic Archives](https://archives.nyphil.org/index.php/open-data).

There are two datasets included in the package. The dataset `nyphil` is a lightly-cleaned, tidy version of the raw data; see `?nyphil` for more info.

```{r example-nyphil}
library(nyphil)
dplyr::glimpse(nyphil)
```

The dataset `nyphil_raw` contains all the variables and original names as downloaded; see `?nyphil_raw` for more info.

## Example

Users are encouraged to use these datasets for exploration, learning, and fun.

```{r data-viz, echo=FALSE}
plot_dta <- nyphil %>% 
  select(program_id, event_type, season, composer_name) %>%
  group_by(season, composer_name) %>%
  distinct() %>% 
  ungroup()

plot_dta %>% 
  separate(composer_name, c("first", "last"), ",  ") %>% 
  mutate(composer_name = paste(last, first)) %>% 
  count(composer_name, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  top_n(20) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(fct_reorder(composer_name, n), n)) + 
  geom_col(fill = "#991d65") +
  geom_text(aes(label = n), hjust = 1.2, color = "white") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = element_blank(),
    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = "bold"),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold"),
    plot.title.position = "plot"
  ) +
  labs(title = "Composers with the most performances",
       subtitle = "From 1842-43 to 2021-22",
       x = NULL, y = NULL)
```
